><h3>About</h3>
<p>This idea is the work of Alex Light (<a href="https://twitter.com/ElectricBloo">@ElectricBloo</a>) and Dave Harrison <a href="https://twitter.com/davidharrison92">@davidharrison92</a>), who started to get a little stir crazy as a result of social distancing. </p>
<p>At this point in time, it's a complete experiment. If it works well, then huzzah. If it doesn't, then never mind.</p>

<h3>How do I play?</h3>
<p>We've tried to keep this as similar to a pub quiz in the real world. It's all live, and you've got to turn up to play. Even if you're at home</p>
<p>Get together with whoever you're isolated with, or use FaceTime / Skype / Hangouts to get together with other lonely folk</p>
<ul>
	<li>Teams of up to <strong>four people</strong>. </li>
	<li>One person should be responsible for submitting the answers for each round<br>
		 <em>(They can be team captain, if they want to feel extra special)</em></li>
	<li><strong>We trust you not to cheat.</strong> That means no Google! We know you can. But why would you?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Does this cost money? / Can I donate?</h3>  
<p>Yes it does. Servers cost money to run!</p>
<p>Donations are welcome here: <a href="paypal.me/daveharrison92">paypal.me/daveharrison92</a>, and we'll be eternally grateful</p>. One day we might even be able to give out prizes.</p>

<h3>It's broken!!!!</h3>
<p>This was built in a hurry! It's all a bit of an experiment. Sorry!</p>
<p>For technical questions - speak to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidharrison92">Dave (on Twitter)</a>.</p>
