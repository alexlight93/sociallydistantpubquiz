                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>This idea is the work of Alex Light (<a href="https://twitter.com/Electricloo">@ElectricBloo</a>) and Dave Harrison <a href="https://twitter.com/davidharrison92">@davidharrison92</a>), who started to get a little stir crazy as a result of social distancing. </p>
                    <p>We run quizzes every Friday night (with some special one!). Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/PubQuizStreams">@PubQuizStreams</a>) so you don't miss one.</p>

                    <h3>How do I play?</h3>
                    <p>We've tried to keep this as similar to a pub quiz in the real world. It's all live, and you've got to turn up to play. Even if you're at home</p>

                    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 col-xs-12 text-center">

                    </div>

                    <p>Get together with whoever you're isolated with, or use FaceTime / Skype / Hangouts to get together with other lonely folk</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Teams of up to <strong>four people</strong>. </li>
                        <li>One person should be responsible for submitting the answers for each round<br>
                             <em>(They can be team captain, if they want to feel extra special)</em></li>
                        <li><strong>We trust you not to cheat.</strong> That means no Google! We know you can. But why would you?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Does this cost money? / Can I donate?</h3>
                    <p>Yes it does. Servers cost money to run! Currently it costs us around Â£20 per quiz in domain, database and hosting fees. Our time is given freely.</p>
                    <p>You're completely welcome to donate! One day we might even be able to give out prizes.</p>
